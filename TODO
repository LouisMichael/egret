Web Interface:
- Add ability to save tests for future runs (and clear this) [DONE]
- Add ability to load tests (sessions) from a plaintext file
- Add tracking capabilities
- Generate regular expressions from examples or wizard

Command Line Interface:
- Add exception handling to catch re.compile errors.

Refactoring:
- punct_marks being passed along?
- possibly generate the character set sooner
- make CharSet a class with public and private sections
- traversal and subsequent processing (process_path) is inefficient and messy

Enhancements:
- Better duplicated character sets in character set warnings.
- Category for alphanumeric strings with some acceptable punctuation that permits only punctuation. 
- String where all optional items (? and *) are not selected.
  * Misses single period on \d*\.\d*
- Replace clear alphanumeric strings [\w+] with a word or number.
- Double every punctuation mark.
- Add a space before and after each punctuation mark (separately).
- Remove each space (separately).
- Analyzing "rejected" strings from tool that are actually accepted.
- Analyze effects from the path traversal algorithm.
- Group results better
